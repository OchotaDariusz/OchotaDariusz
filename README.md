- 🌱 Fresh Full Stack Developer (thanks to [CodeCool](https://codecool.com))

> I am very interested in programming web applications. I'm fresh from a one-year Full Stack developer course by CodeCool. I have experience working on Backend in Python/Flask Java/Spring Node/Express Node/NestJS environments with SQL databases. I also have experience working on Frontend with pure JavaScript/CSS/HTML and working in React. I am constantly expanding my knowledge, after a course in the field of new technologies, e.g. TypeScript or NoSQL databases. I am also open to new technology and changes, I am communicative and helpful and I can deal with stress at work. I am organized and I know the Agile/Scrum methodology.
